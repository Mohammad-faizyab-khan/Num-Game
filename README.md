# Num-Game
 The game generates a random number for the player to guess. The player's input is validated to be numeric. The game provides feedback on the guess and responds to the Enter key. The GUI includes instructions and has a light blue background. The game logic is in the NumberGuessingGame class.
This Python script uses the tkinter library to create a simple GUI for a number guessing game.

The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 that the player has to guess. The player enters their guess into a text entry field. If the guess is too high or too low, the game informs the player accordingly. If the guess is correct, the game congratulates the player.

The game also includes some features to improve the user experience:

The text entry field only accepts numeric input.
The game responds when the player presses the Enter key, checking the current guess.
The game provides instructions to the player and uses a pleasant light blue background color.
The game is encapsulated in a class called NumberGuessingGame, which is instantiated and run in the main function.
